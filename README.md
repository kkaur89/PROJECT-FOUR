## Project Overview

For my final project, I decided I wanted to work in a pair. I wanted the balance of gaining more experience in coding alongside someone else, but also have more autonomy and responsibility to create a working app vs working in a group. Based on mine and my coding partner's interest in health and fitness, we decided to create a Full stack app that was based around all things related to these topics. We would have articles, workout videos and food recipes that all centered around general well being. This app was created using python, django and postgreSQL in the backend.

**Functionality:**
- Users are able to register and login.
- Users are able to filter articles based on category, read the articles, like them and save them to their profile.
- Users are able to filter videos based on the category, watch the videos and like them.
- Users are able to filter recipes based on the category, read the recipes and like them.
- User can follow other users and they have their own profile page

## Project Brief

- **Use a Python Django API** using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
- **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
- **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models

## Project Timeline - 9 Days

### Day One - Planning

As per all the other projects, the first day was spent writing pseudo code, creating a plan for MVP and post MVP feautres. We also spent this day wireframing, then splitting out tasks on a trello board and finally creating a entity relationship diagram for the database.

**Wireframe:**
