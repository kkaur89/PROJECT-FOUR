## Project Overview

for my final project, I decided I wanted to work in a pair. I wanted the balance of gaining more expereince in coding alongside someone else, but also have more autonomy and reposonsilty to create a working app vs working in a group. Based on mine and my coding partners intrest in health and fitness, we decided to create a Full stack app that was based around all things related to these topics. We would have articles, workout videos and food recipes that all centered around general well being. This app was created using python, django and postgreSQL in the backend.

**Functionality:**
- User is able to register and login.
- User is able to filter articles based on category, read the articles, like them and save them to their profile.
- User is able to  videos based on the category, watch the videos and like them.
- User is able to recipes based on the category, read the recipes and like them.
- User can follow other users and they have their own profile page
