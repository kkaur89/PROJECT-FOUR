    "text": "Many of us fall into one of two categories: Air fryer-obsessed or desperately wishing we had one because there's so much to love about it. After all, the air fryer is relatively easy to use and can recreate that deep-fried texture and flavor we hate to admit we love.\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with the air fryer, let us brief you: It's similar to a convection oven and uses a circulation of hot air to cook. The hot air takes the place of the vat of oil you'd find in a deep frier, which is one of the reasons users are falling in love with this nifty machine. Without the need to submerge food in oil, you cut down on both calories and fat in your dish.\r\nNow that we've convinced you that the air fryer is the next best thing to hit kitchen counters, we've rounded up 5 easy air fryer chicken recipes to make in minutes.",

Asian-Inspired Glazed Air Fryer Chicken Thighs\r\n\r\n​361 calories​\r\n​46 grams of protein​\r\n\r\nFor a burst of flavor, try adding a glaze or marinade to your air-fried chicken, like this Asian-inspired recipe calls for. Because this glaze includes soy sauce, which is high in sodium, Nicole Rodriguez, RDN, recommends swapping for liquid coconut aminos, which has 60 milligrams of sodium per serving instead of the 500 milligrams in soy sauce.",
    "text_three": "2. Air Fryer Grilled Chicken Kebabs\r\n\r\n​136 calories​\r\n​23 grams of protein​\r\n\r\nWe often pigeonhole kebabs to the summer season, thanks to the grill, but air frying allows us to make this delicious meal no matter what the weather's like outside. \"Kebabs are the perfect vehicle to add more plants into our diets,\" Rodriguez says. After all, you can skewer any veggie — or fruit! — for a perfect lunch or dinner. \"Just skip pre-made seasonings and prepare your own with dried spices to reduce the overall sodium content.\"",
    "text_four": "3. Air Fryer General Tso's Chicken\r\n\r\n​397 calories​\r\n​46 grams of protein​\r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese takeout cravings hit, consider making this healthier version instead. \"For about a quarter of the calories and a tenth of the fat of the original, this is a winner, winner chicken dinner,\" Rodriguez says. To make it a well-balanced meal, serve with a nutrient-dense green vegetable on the side like bok choy or broccoli.",
    "text_five": "4. Air Fryer Chicken Fajitas\r\n\r\n​214 calories​\r\n​26 grams of protein​\r\n\r\nInstead of babysitting your chicken and peppers over a stove, simply toss them in the air fryer and you've got a ready-made meal in minutes. \"Serve alongside corn tortillas, which are lower in sodium and carbs [than flour tortillas] and top with plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream,\" Rodriguez suggests.",
    "text_six": "5. Air Fryer Chicken Parmesan\r\n\r\n​541 calories​\r\n​47 grams of protein​\r\n\r\nEven though this Italian-American favorite is a better-for-you option when air fried, Rodriguez warns that it's full of sodium. \"Keep the cheese and substitute no-salt-added canned tomato sauce for the marinara,\" Rodriguez says. And if you're watching your carb intake, skip the pasta and serve alongside vegetables.",

    "text": "That's right — eating chocolate could help you lose weight. It's not a magic bullet (sorry!), but there are few ways that a little chocolate may encourage your weight-loss goals.\r\n\r\n\"Adding chocolate [to your diet] can make lifestyle changes feel more realistic, fun and doable long term,\" says DJ Blatner, RDN and author of ​The Superfood Swap​.\r\n\r\nIndeed, chocolate may boost your mood, per a March 2018 study in ​Planta Medica​. Researchers think the benefit comes from the good-for-you polyphenols in the sweet stuff.\r\n\r\n\"When you are in a better mood, you are likely to do more loving, healthy acts of self-care like exercise and making nourishing meals,\" Blatner says.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, chocolate might help lower stress, says an October 2014 study in the ​International Journal of Health Sciences​. When students ate dark or milk chocolate daily for two weeks (compared to white chocolate), their perceived stress improved — particularly in people assigned female at birth.\r\n\r\nWhen you're stressed, your levels of cortisol (the \"stress hormone\") are higher and, over time, that can lead to weight gain.\r\n\r\n\"Plus, less stress means less stress-eating,\" adds Blatner.\r\n\r\nThat said, not all chocolate-eating is helpful if you're trying to lose weight.\r\n\r\nHere are four mistakes you might be making when it comes to chocolate and losing weight.",

    "text_two": "Mistake 1: Taking an 'All or Nothing' Approach\r\n\r\nFor some people, complete abstinence is the way to go. But for others — and there's science to support this — an all-or-nothing approach could backfire.\r\n\r\n\"What I see most in my practice is that when people want to lose weight, often it is the strict rules — cutting out food groups, removing all of the foods they love — that set them up to fail,\" Blatner says.\r\n\r\nInstead, a little indulgence here and there could help you avoid a binge. That's because depriving yourself can spark cravings, according to a June 2020 review in ​Current Nutrition Reports​, and that could eventually lead to eating more of the exact food or foods you're trying to avoid.\r\n\r\nIn the review, researchers found that across multiple studies, when people cut out food groups (carbs, chocolate, salty foods), they then craved that exact food group after a few days or a week. (In the long-term, however — think: three months to two years — studies suggest the cravings eventually go away.)",
    "text_three": "Mistake 2: Limiting Your Chocolate Treat to After Dinner Only\r\n\r\nThis might sound slightly unconventional, but hear us out.\r\n\r\nDieters with obesity were assigned to follow one of two diets: a low-carb breakfast or a high-protein, high-carb breakfast that included a dessert. After four months, both groups successfully lost weight — around 30 pounds, according to the March 2012 study in ​Steroids​.\r\n\r\nThen, during the following four months — the \"weight maintenance\" phase — the low-carb breakfast eaters re-gained some of the weight they lost while the dieters who ate dessert with breakfast lost, on average, an additional 15 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis is just one study, so we can't say after breakfast is the \"right\" time for chocolate, but we can say it's worth thinking outside the box (of chocolates...sorry, we had to!).\r\n\r\nPlus, there's good evidence that eating a bigger breakfast and smaller dinner can help with weight loss.",
    "text_four": "Mistake 3: Baking With Chocolate\r\n\r\nThis is where the delivery vehicle — and the other passengers alongside chocolate (oh hey, sugar and butter) — is more important than the chocolate.\r\n\r\nYes, we've established that indulging in moderation fits into a weight-loss diet. But if chocolate is what you desire, just go with a piece of dark chocolate. That's because baked items like cakes, cookies and pies are one of the biggest sources of added sugars in the American diet, according to the American Heart Association. And too much added sugar in your diet can cause weight gain and up your risk of obesity, per the AHA.",
    "text_five": "Mistake 4: Choosing Milk Chocolate Over Dark Chocolate\r\n\r\n\"Dark chocolate usually has less sugar and more beneficial flavonoids than its milk chocolate cousin,\" says Blatner.\r\n\r\nFlavonoids are anti-inflammatory antioxidants that might help with stress. And less sugar is better for weight loss, as we noted above.\r\n\r\nDark chocolate may also help you feel satisfied with less.\r\n\r\n\"Researchers from the University of Copenhagen found dark chocolate to be more filling than milk chocolate,\" says Blatner. The study was quite small, but when participants ended a 12-hour fast with dark chocolate versus milk chocolate, they went on to eat less pizza two and a half hours later.",
    "text_six": "How to Eat Chocolate for Weight Loss\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep chocolate in your life while following a weight-loss diet, aim to eat no more than about 1 ounce a day of dark chocolate, and find ways to savor that ounce, advises Blatner. Here are a few of her mindful eating ideas:\r\n\r\n* Eat your dark chocolate from a cute little plate and eat it while seated to make it more mindful than just eating it while watching TV or standing in the kitchen.\r\n\r\n* Sip a cup of mint tea with your dark chocolate to make it feel more special, like an evening ritual.\r\n\r\n* Bulk up your dark chocolate treat with some fresh berries on the side. Dark chocolate plus berries is the perfect pairing.\r\n\r\n* Don't get bored, make bark. Melt the dark chocolate, pour it on parchment, sprinkle add-ons like cayenne, unsweetened coconut flakes or puffed brown rice cereal, freeze it and enjoy. (I call this making your own mini DIY candy bar!)",

    "text_two": "Calories in Coffee and Nutrition Information\r\n\r\nFrom flat whites in Australia to espresso in Italy, there are about as many types of and ways to drink coffee as there are people who drink it around the world. But your average cup (6 ounces) of regular black coffee offers the following calories and nutrition info, according to the USDA:\r\n\r\n​* Calories:​ 2\r\n​* Total Fat:​ 0 g, 0% Daily Value (DV)\r\n​* Cholesterol:​ 0 mg, 0% DV\r\n​* Sodium:​ 3.6 mg, 0% DV\r\n​* Total Carbohydrates:​ 0 g, 0% DV\r\n​* Dietary fiber:​ 0 g, 0% DV\r\n​* Sugar:​ 0 g\r\n​* Protein:​ 0.2 g, 0% DV\r\n​* Calcium:​ 3.6 mg, 0% DV\r\n​* Potassium:​ 87.2 mg, 2% DV\r\n​* Phosphorus:​ 5.3 mg, 0% DV\r\n\r\nThe amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee varies. So does the size: A \"cup\" of coffee may be defined as anything from 6 to 8 ounces (the actual size of a cup measurement) — and, of course, sizing will vary from one café to another.\r\n\r\nOn average, an 8-ounce cup contains 95 milligrams of caffeine, per the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But that's just an average: The same amount of coffee from Starbucks (brewed with Pike's Blend) clocks in at 155 milligrams of caffeine, per the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\r\n\r\nWarning\r\n\r\nMany of us drink coffee specifically for its caffeine content, but caffeine can cause unpleasant side effects, such as anxiety, sleep disruption, restlessness and a fast heart rate, per the U.S. National Library of Medicine. On the flip side, if you’re in the habit of enjoying caffeinated coffee, quitting that daily habit — especially cold turkey — can lead to headaches, irritability and other withdrawal symptoms.",

Scroll on for the calorie counts and nutrition facts for common coffee brands and varieties.\r\n\r\nCoffee With Semi-Skimmed, Low-Fat or Nonfat Milk\r\n\r\nAdd a dash of milk to your cup of java and you'll change the drink's nutritional makeup.\r\n\r\nSkim milk — or skimmed milk, as it's known in the United Kingdom — is whole milk with the fat removed. Semi-skimmed milk — which is common in the U.K. — has a fat content of 1.7 percent, according to the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland. Think of semi-skimmed milk as an in-between option, with half the fat content of whole milk.\r\n\r\nSimilar varieties of low-fat milk in the United States have either 1 or 2 percent fat content levels.\r\nHere's a look at the nutritional breakdown of your cup of coffee if you add 1 fluid ounce (2 tablespoons) of 2 percent milk to your 6-ounce cup, according to the USDA:\r\n\r\n​Calories:​ 17\r\n​Total Fat:​ 0.6 g, 1% DV\r\n​Saturated Fat:​ 0.4 g, 2% DV\r\n​Cholesterol:​ 2.4 mg, 1% DV\r\n​Sodium:​ 15.9 mg, 1% DV\r\n​Total Carbohydrates:​ 1.5 g, 0% DV\r\n​Dietary fiber:​ 0 g, 0% DV\r\n​Sugar:​ 1.5 g\r\n​Protein:​ 1.2 g, 2% DV\r\n​Vitamin C:​ 0.1 mg, 0% DV\r\n​Vitamin D:​ 0.4 μg, 2% DV\r\n​Calcium:​ 40.2 mg, 3% DV\r\n​Potassium:​ 129.9 mg, 3% DV\r\n​Phosphorus:​ 33.4 mg, 3% DV\r\n\r\nUsing 2 percent milk will deliver about the same calories and nutrition as semi-skimmed milk. You'll take in fewer calories if you choose to use 1 percent milk.

The latest green tea Frappuccino, the Matcha Green Tea Crème Frappuccino, mixes matcha powder together with milk and ice. By default, this frappuccino is topped with sweetened whipped cream.\r\n\r\nThe concoction is available in Starbucks' three sizes: tall, grande and venti.

An 18-ounce milkshake (just slightly larger than a grande frappuccino) from one popular ice cream franchise has 458 calories, per the USDA.\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWhile different brands and blends vary, single servings of most types of regular coffee (without any cream or sugar added) have approximately:\r\n\r\n2-4 calories\r\n0 g fat\r\n0 g carbs\r\n0 g sugar\r\n0 g protein\r\n95 to 155 mg caffeine",

    "text": "Keeping up with all of the weight-loss programs out there is no easy task. From Weight Watchers to Beachbody to Noom, each one seems to promise impressive results along with the guarantee that it will be the last diet you'll ever need.\r\n\r\nThe truth? Some of these plans are rooted in science, while some are based on, well, not much at all. So how do you choose the best program — aka one that will actually work for you and isn't a total scam? Here's what you should know.\r\n\r\nWhat's the Difference Between a Weight-Loss Program and a Diet?\r\n\r\nFirst, let's clarify what we mean when we say weight-loss program, and how these differ from your average diet. The key word here is \"program.\" We're talking about something more comprehensive than just a guideline on what to eat, like the low-carb keto diet or high-protein paleo plan.\r\n\r\nWeight-loss programs typically have a company behind them and require some type of subscription or membership. Most of them go beyond telling you what to eat and aim to provide everything you need to lose weight, from counseling to recipes to exercise recommendations.\r\n\r\nIn short, a weight-loss program should give you much more than a diet. A good program will encourage you to shift to a healthier lifestyle, including daily physical activity, and it may also offer access to nutrition experts who can lend support and answer your questions.",

    "text_two": "How to Tell if a Weight-Loss Program Is Legit\r\n\r\nBefore you can narrow down the field of contenders, you first need to identify which programs are trustworthy and effective — and which might do more harm than good. It can be tricky to tell the real deals from the fakes when that stunning before-and-after photo pops up in your Instagram feed or you read a compelling testimonial about someone who finally hit that dream number on the scale. Fortunately, there are several ways to know if a program will really deliver on its promises. The first clue? It should prioritize getting healthy over getting thin.",
    "text_three": "The Deal With Weight Watchers\r\n\r\nWeight Watchers, which recently rebranded as WW, has been helping people lose weight for more than 50 years and is often named among the best commercial diet plans. The program assigns points to foods based on their nutritional value, and participants are allotted a daily points budget based on their starting weight and how much they want to lose.\r\nWhile research has found Weight Watchers to be effective and the program is especially lauded for the support system it offers its members, it does have a few features that aren't ideal for some people, including the cost of the more structured plans.",
    "text_four": "All About the Mayo Clinic Diet\r\n\r\nYou may have seen \"Mayo Clinic\" paired with any number of fad diets, including those that encourage followers to eat just grapefruit or consume only cabbage soup in order to drop pounds. But don't confuse these posers with the real Mayo Clinic Diet, which is grounded in science and backed by the organization's doctors and other experts.\r\nAs you might expect from such a reputable source, this program is balanced, takes a slow-and-steady approach to weight loss and helps members maintain when they're done losing. But the program also requires a level of personal responsibility that might deter some people from hopping on board.",
    "text_five": "What to Know About Jenny Craig\r\n\r\nLike Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig has been around for decades, and it often appears on lists of the best commercial diet plans. What sets the program apart from many others, though, is that it provides members with pre-made frozen meals and snacks. Beyond adding a bit of fresh produce, subscribers don't even need to go to the grocery store or cook while following the plan.\r\nWhile this approach is certainly convenient, it doesn't work for everyone's lifestyle. And because the plan includes a good amount of processed foods, there may be health concerns for some people.",
    "text_six": "Breaking Down the Noom Diet\r\n\r\nAlthough newer on the scene than other tried-and-true plans, Noom is used by nearly 50 million people worldwide. The app-based program aims to educate members on how to make healthier choices (no foods are off-limits) and help them implement small, sustainable lifestyle changes that will result in long-term weight loss and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe catch? It's not a quick-fix kind of diet, and plans run on the pricier side. So members must be ready and willing to put in the work (and cash) to see success.",

It's present in every cell in the body and helps make hormones and vitamin D (which is actually a hormone) as well as build cells.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of cholesterol you need to know about:\r\n\r\nHDL: high-density lipoproteins, the \"good\" kind of cholesterol that works to prevent heart disease-causing plaque in the arteries\r\nLDL: low-density lipoproteins, the \"bad\" type of cholesterol that can cause plaque buildup\r\nVLDL: very low-density lipoproteins, another type of \"bad\" cholesterol that can lead to increased plaque\r\nThen you've got triglycerides, which are a type of fat that comes from sugar as well fatty foods such as butter and oil. Triglycerides technically aren't a type of cholesterol, but they're usually measured at the same time, and they're also involved in your risk of heart disease.\r\n\r\nHere's everything you need to know about the types of cholesterol and the levels that are considered healthy.\r\n\r\nWhat Causes High Cholesterol?\r\nwoman eating burger with saturated fat and cholesterol\r\nBeing overweight can lead to high cholesterol levels, but changing up your diet and adding some exercise can help lower your numbers.\r\nImage Credit: miodrag ignjatovic/E+/GettyImages\r\nHaving high cholesterol levels simply means there is too much of the waxy substance in your blood, which puts your heart at risk.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to assume that high cholesterol is an older person's disease, but the reality is more and more folks are developing it in their 20s and 30s — especially if they have risk factors such as being overweight,\" says Suzanne Steinbaum, DO, a cardiologist in New York City and spokesperson for the American Heart Association.\r\n\r\nMore than 12 percent of adults over the age of 20 have high cholesterol, defined as levels greater than 240 mg/dL, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\nAside from a genetic condition that leads to high cholesterol levels (called familial hypercholesterolemia), lifestyle factors play a significant role in those high numbers. The good news is that, in many cases, high cholesterol levels can be lowered by making a few changes to your daily habits.",
    "text_four": "How to Lower Your Cholesterol Numbers\r\n\r\nIf a recent blood test shows you have high or borderline-high cholesterol, it's not all bad news.\r\n\r\n\"Your cholesterol, especially your LDL, is incredibly responsive to lifestyle,\" Dr. Steinbaum says. \"So, after six weeks of healthy strategies such as eating right and exercising, you should start seeing changes.\"\r\n\r\nThere are other effective ways to lower your cholesterol levels and bolster your heart health, such as losing just 5 to 10 percent of your body weight if you're overweight. And it's pretty easy to get started.",
    "text_five": "How Food Affects Your Cholesterol Levels\r\n\r\nCutting back on saturated fat is a great place to start when you want to lower your LDL levels, but it's important to add more of the right foods to your diet, too.\r\n\r\nTry swapping saturated fatty foods, such as meat and full-fat dairy, for foods rich in unsaturated fats, such as avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil. It's also important to include plenty of high-fiber foods in your diet.\r\n\r\nEating 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber (aka the type of fiber that binds with cholesterol in the intestines and shuttles it out of the body) each day can help drop your total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels by 5 to 11 points, according to the National Lipid Association.",
    "text_six": "Can Exercise Help Lower Cholesterol?\r\n\r\nMost people think about diet when it comes to managing cholesterol, but you shouldn't ignore regular exercise. Any activity (jogging, HIIT workouts, lifting weights, dancing — there's something for everyone) helps raise your good HDL, which sweeps the harmful LDL out of your blood vessels, as well as drops those harmful triglycerides.\r\n\r\n\"I tell my patients that exercise is even better [than medication] because it's the only thing that's proven to raise HDL cholesterol — no drug can do that,\" Dr. Steinbaum says.",

    "text": "If you don't own a barbell, you might think that heavier lifting at home isn't an option. But you can recreate your favorite barbell moves with a set of dumbbells and a smarter strategy. Specifically, slowing down the speed of your reps.\r\n\r\n\"Tempo work is one of the best ways to make us stronger, work on control of movement and make exercises harder when we don't have more weight to put on the bar,\" Morit Summers, CPT, creator of Brooklyn-based training studio Form Fitness, tells LIVESTRONG.com.\r\n\r\nThat's because slowing the tempo of any exercise progresses the movement by increasing time under tension (or the amount of time your muscle is working against resistance), which ramps up the challenge and builds muscle, Summers says.\r\n\r\nWe promise you'll miss your barbell much less once you try these six dumbbell exercises that tie in a 3-1-1 tempo (3 seconds to lower, 1 second to hold, 1 second to lift the weight back up).",

    "text": "Improving your balance may not be your number one fitness goal, but it should definitely be high on the list. Why? Because balance affects every other area of your life — including your workouts.\r\n\r\nThink about it: Even walking around requires stability, as does bending down to pick something up, going up the stairs or climbing onto a step stool, not to mention exercises like running, lifting weights and yoga.",

    "text_two": "Better Balance Now Means Healthier Ageing Later\r\n\r\nBalance is crucial regardless of your age or activity level. The main reason why is also the most obvious: Increasing your stability means you're less likely to stumble and fall. The older we get, the more prone we are to slips and injuries. In fact, one in four American adults over the age of 65 falls each year, and those falls result in three million emergency room visits, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n\r\nWorking on your balance also strengthens the support around your joints, which helps keep them healthy in the long run. It also helps injuries (like ankle sprains) heal faster because it improves proprioception, aka your sense where your body is in the space around you, which typically suffers after you get hurt. Even better, there are about as many ways to improve balance as there are benefits, so you can find the exercise approach that's best for you.",
    "text_three": "Balance Exercises for Beginners\r\n\r\nFirst, start with the basics. How well do you fare balancing on one leg? Could you hold that position forever, or do you feel like you'll topple over immediately? Does that change if you're standing on carpet or a hard floor? How do your left and right legs compare? Once you have a sense of your balance baseline, you can work on strengthening the core and lower-body muscles that play a role in your stability.\r\n\r\nFrom lunges to speed skaters and even a homemade obstacle course, there are a variety of easy exercises you can do at home or anywhere else you have the time and space. Or if you've identified a particular area of weakness, you can try incorporating strengthening moves specifically for your feet and ankles, knees or hips. Check out the list of balance exercises below and start adding some to your daily routine.",
    "text_four": "Use a BOSU Ball\r\n\r\nOnce you've mastered the basics of body-weight balance training, you may want to start incorporating some equipment into the mix. The BOSU ball (aka balance trainer) — you know, that half-flat, half-stability-ball-looking thing at your gym — is a great place to start.\r\n\r\nBOSU, which stands for \"both sides up,\" is a versatile piece of fitness equipment that you can use for rehabbing an injury or amping up the intensity of exercises like planks, squats, push-ups and glute bridges. Not sure where to start? Check out our recommendations below.",
    "text_five": "Try a Balance Board\r\n\r\nThe balance board has always been a popular fitness gadget among certain groups of exercisers (like surfers), but this workout tool has become a bit more mainstream in recent years. It's a fun way to improve your stability and spatial awareness, and you can use it in your living room or even at your standing desk.\r\n\r\nIt can be a bit tricky to get the hang of using a balance board at first, which is why we created the beginner's guide below. We've covered all the basics, from the benefits of standing on a balance board to the best exercises to start with and how to do them safely to everything you need to know about different board brands.",
    "text_six": "Practice Standing Yoga Poses\r\n\r\nYoga might be one of the first things you think about when you're working on improving your balance, and with good reason: Every standing yoga pose — from Mountain to Half Moon — helps you build a solid strength foundation from the ground up.\r\n\r\nOne of the (many) great things about practicing yoga is that it's modifiable for any fitness level. New to yoga? Start with grounding poses like Warrior I and II so you have both feet on the floor. If you're a bit more advanced and looking for a challenge, take flight with single-leg poses like Tree pose and even Standing Splits. For even more standing yoga poses, read through the following list.",

    "text": "Exercise to lose weight doesn't exist in a vacuum: No amount of crunches, tricep extensions or hours spent on an elliptical will answer your weight-loss prayers all on their own. The best weight-loss plans include a comprehensive workout routine — with cardio and strength training — and a healthy diet.\r\n\r\nBut even if, as the saying goes, abs are made in the kitchen, you shouldn't just toss your running shoes to the side and ditch your weight-loss workouts entirely. Instead, you're going to want to maximize the benefits of your exercise of choice by picking the right cardio, strategically upping the intensity of your sessions and adding weekly strengthening to your mix.\r\n\r\nWhether you're looking to lose 20 pounds or 100, our guide to fitness for weight loss has a workout for you.",

You'll also burn more fat in less time if you make a few simple tweaks.",
    "text_three": "Why You Should Build Muscle to Shed Weight\r\n\r\nSure, cardio blasts calories, but strength training can be just as — if not more — effective for long-term weight loss. \r\n\r\nWhy? Building muscle actually increases your calorie burn long after your workout's over, even if you're just watching Netflix. (Really!) \r\n\r\nYour best bet for a weight-loss exercise plan that really delivers is combining both cardio and weight lifting — especially if you know how to set up the most efficient workout in the least amount of time.",

    "text_five": "What About Running?\r\n\r\nRunning burns an impressive number of calories (around 200 for just a 30-minute jog, according to estimates from Harvard Health Publishing!).\r\n\r\nBut if you really want to lose weight running, you need to start slow, cross-train and eat a nutritious diet, too. \r\n\r\nScheduling rest days is key to preventing injury so you can run on the regular, as is varying your terrain, speed and intensity for the best weight-loss results.",
